Complaints
----------

This is a list of things we need to get fixed in Unturned itself to allow full functionality!

- Zombies can't be spawned after the first load-time sending.
    - This is due to the clientside variable "ZombieRegion.isNetworked", which is trivial to remove without trouble.
	- Only workaround is to ask clients to reconnect after spawning a zombie.
